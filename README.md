#Loopback connector nodes for Node-RED
Loopback is a powerful NodeJS framework to create REST APIs based on declarative model definitions. Node-RED is yet another porwerful tool to wire together APIs and online services.

This project provides a set of custom Node-RED nodes which can be used to integrate Node-RED with any loopback application. This integration greatly enhances the existing capabilities of loopback application by allowing to observe the application in Node-RED and inject code at runtime without touching the original application.


#Prerequisite
It is required to run Node-RED in the loopback application. This project provides start-node-red.js script which can be copied into server\boot folder of your loopback application.

start-node-red.js will start a Node-RED server when the loopback application is started.
